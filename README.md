# 🛡️ Home Network Security Assessment Report

This project presents a sample vulnerability assessment of a typical home network, conducted in a format inspired by Dradis and aligned with the NIST SP 800-53 cybersecurity framework.

## 📋 Summary

The assessment identifies security gaps, misconfigurations, and potential risks across common home network devices, including:

- Router
- IoT Devices (Smart TV, Printer)
- Laptops
- Guest Wi-Fi Network

The report includes:
- Device inventory
- Risk findings with CVSS scores
- Recommendations based on NIST controls
- Tools used for scanning and analysis
